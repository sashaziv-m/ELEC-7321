# Advanced Networking course

These pages contain the material and assignments for the **Advanced Networking
course (ELEC-E7321)** at Aalto University. The assignment descriptions refer to
_[MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/section.php?id=272696)_ learning
platform available for Aalto students enrolled on the course. If you
are not enrolled on the course, but are just interested on the topic, feel free
to try out the tasks nevertheless.

Most of the code examples and assignment templates in this material are provided
in the **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** language, some examples that are
closer to the kernel and device interface level also in C. However, you may use
any language of your preference for the assignments. Some of the assignments
closer to the system-level may not be doable with higher-level interpreted
languages, though.

The GitHub repository for the
material is **[available](https://github.com/PasiSa/AdvancedNetworking)**. If you
find something to correct or add, feel free to drop an [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/PasiSa/AdvancedNetworking/issues/new)
in the repository, or just send [E-mail](mailto:pasi.sarolahti@aalto.fi) to the
author.

1. [Introduction](intro/)
