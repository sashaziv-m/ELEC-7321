# Advanced Networking Course (ELEC-E7321)

This repository contains the material and assignments for the Advanced Networking course (ELEC-E7321) at Aalto University.

## Course Overview

This course covers advanced topics in networking, exploring system-level programming and modern network protocols.

### Topics Covered
1.  **Introduction**: Overview of the course and networking concepts.
2.  **Network Programming Basics**: Fundamentals of socket programming.
3.  **Server Programming**: Managing concurrency and high-performance server architecture.
4.  **Congestion Control**: Algorithms and mechanisms for regulating network traffic.
5.  **Evolution of the Web & QUIC**: Modern web protocols and the QUIC transport layer.
6.  **Linux Networking Internals**: Deep dive into how Linux handles networking.
7.  **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**: Programmable networks and control planes.
8.  **Datacenter Networking**: Architecture and protocols for data center environments.
9.  **IoT & Challenged Networks**: Networking constraints and solutions for IoT.

## Practical Assignments

The course includes practical assignments involving programming and network configuration. Most code examples and templates are provided in **Rust** (some low-level examples in C), but you may use any language of your preference. Note that some system-level tasks may require languages closer to the hardware (C/C++, Rust).
